== NAME

darcs-fast-import - darcs backend to the 'fast-import stream' format

== SYNOPSIS

darcs-fast-import [<options>]

== DESCRIPTION

darcs-fast-import can produce a darcs repository from a fast-import
stream, read from the standard input. It supports incremental conversion
as well, via the --import-marks / --export-marks switches.

== OPTIONS

-h, --help::
	Display usage.

--import-marks::
	Import marks from a given file. This is read at the beginning of the
	conversion at once. Use it if you want to continue an incremental
	conversion.

--export-marks::
	Export marks to a given file at the end of the conversion. It can be the
	same as the one for --import-marks as it is written only once at the
	end. Use it if you want to be able to incrementally update the target
	repository later.

--logfile::
	The output of external commands are redirected to a log file. You can
	specify the path of that file with this parameter.

--symhack::
	Enable hack for symbolic links. darcs add does not handle them
	but in case they are just added, we can create them in the working
	directory. This can be handy in case for example the symbolic link is in
	a subdirectory of the project and you don't even care about that
	subdirectory. So the hack can be useful, but be extremely careful when
	you use it.

--progress=<n>::
	Insert progress statements after every <n> created patches. The
	default is not to print anything as progress info is usually provided by
	the exporter. Use this option in case the exporter does not have such a
	switch but you still want to get some feedback.

== EXIT CODES

The exit code is:

* 0 on success
* 1 on unhandled exception
* 2 in case the stream would try to let the importer create a symlink
