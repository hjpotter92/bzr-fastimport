== NAME

git-darcs - a bidirectional git - darcs gateway

== SYNOPSIS

git-darcs <command> <options>

== DESCRIPTION

git darcs can convert a darcs repo to a git one, can update such an
existing git repo later, and finally can push back your changes from the
git repo to the darcs one.

A typical workflow is:

----
$ mkdir git-repo
$ cd git-repo
$ git init
$ git darcs add upstream ../darcs-repo
$ git darcs pull upstream

... hack, hack, hack ...

$ git darcs push upstream
----

== COMMANDS

The supported commands are the followings:

add::
	This can register a new darcs repo in the git one, so that you
	can fetch from it. The syntax is `add nick path [dfe-options]`.
	Add any options you want to be passed to darcs-fast-export,
	like --encoding=utf-8, or --authors-file AUTHORMAP. Remember
	that if AUTHORMAP is not absolute, it will be interpreted
	relative to the git repository's root directory.

push::
	Transfers your changes created in the current branch back the
	darcs one. The syntax is `push nick`.

fetch::
	Downloads changes from the darcs repo and updates the
	`darcs/<nick>` branch. None of your local branches are updated.

pull::
	Calls `fetch` then `git merge` or `git rebase` based on the
	`branch.<branchname>.rebase` configuration setting, where `<branchname>`
	is the current branch. The default is - just like with `git pull` - is
	to `git merge`.

list::
	List the name [and location] of each registered darcs repo.
	The syntax is `list [-v|--verbose]`.

find-darcs::
	Searches for darcs patches matching a SHA1 prefix.
	The syntax is `find-darcs <sha1-prefix>`.

find-git::
	Searches for git commits matching a darcs patch prefix.
	The syntax is `find-git <patch-prefix>`.
